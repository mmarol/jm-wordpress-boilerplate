# Jay Marolâ€™s starter theme.

This WordPress install is done through Local by Flywheel and has a few things already set up:

- Basic file structure based on the Timber starter theme
- Gulp setup for SCSS and JS compiling as well as BrowserSync reloading
- Relevant node packages
- Basic plugins installed in [plugins/](../../plugins/). These plugins include:
  - [Admin Columns](https://wordpress.org/plugins/codepress-admin-columns/)
  - [Admin Menu Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-menu-editor/)
  - [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) (this links to the free version)
  - [Classic Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/)
  - [Custom Post Type Cleanup](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-cleanup/)
  - [Disable Comments](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-comments/)
  - [Show Current Template](https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-current-template/)
  - [Timber](https://wordpress.org/plugins/timber-library/)
- An example custom post type. These are defined in [lib/](./lib/) and registered in [functions.php](./functions.php). The post type is set up to use [page-example-page.php](./page-example-page.php) as the archive template. This can be changed in [lib/custom-types.php](./lib/custom-types.php) in the `rewrite` rule.
- An ACF options page for both the header and footer. This can be disabled in [functions.php](./functions.php) on lines 76 and 106-129.
- A reorganized WordPress admin menu order.

## First things first

1. Run `npm install` to install all relevant node packages
2. Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) in this theme folder if you do not have it installed already.
3. Run `composer require timber/timber` to install Timber.
4. Change the theme information in [style.css](./style.css) and replace [screenshot.png](./screenshot.png).
5. Activate the theme in the CMS.
6. Change the proxy URL in [gulpfile.js](./gulpfile.js) to match the locally served URL.
7. Run `gulp` and make changes to a `scss`, `js`, `php` and `twig` file to make sure the site is being served at a BrowserSync URL and is reloading correctly.

## What's here?

`src/` is where you can keep your static front-end scripts, styles, or images. In other words, your Sass files, JS files, fonts, and SVGs would live here. The `gulp` process compiles these files to the `dist/` folder. Running `gulp --prod` will build production ready files to the folder instead.

`src/scss/` is organized using the [7-1 pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern) and is using the newer [`@use` Sass rule](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use).

`templates/` contains all of your Twig templates. These pretty much correspond 1 to 1 with the PHP files that respond to the WordPress template hierarchy.

`lib/` contains custom post type, menu, taxonomy and widget definition files

`bin/` and `tests/` ... basically don't worry about (or remove) these unless you know what they are and want to.
